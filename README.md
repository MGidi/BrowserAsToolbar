# BrowserAsToolbar
An executable along with VS .NET source code and an html demo file. The executable can run with path to a website or a html file as parameter, and it will display it in a resizable window (the size and location on the screen will be saved for the next run).

The demo is a webpage that execute heDate.js (https://github.com/erezdaniel7/he-date) to display the Hebrew date and date_time.js to display the day of the week and Gregorian date (this is a common piece of code on the internet which i couldn't find the owner of)
This fork built to be used on a kiosk display screen at charity office, and created per a request on an IT Facebook community. https://www.facebook.com/groups/it.pro.forum/permalink/1861192817229085/
